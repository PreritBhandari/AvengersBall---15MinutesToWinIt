For an example scene for each of the three death fx (fire, ice and blood), load the corresponding .unity example scene. Pressing the left mouse button will trigger the death sequence effects. Alternatively, drag the required example character from the Prefabs folder in the Project window into the Hierarchy window.

A controllable character as seen in the example video has not been included with this package as the Asset Store asks for the Standard Assets not to be included to avoid potential compatibility issues. However, step by step instructions are included here to get a demo character set up:

1. First load "Character_Death_FX_Fire.unity" for a demo environment to place your character in. Delete the "Demo_Man_Fire" GameObject (in the hierarchy window).

2. Import the Character Standard Assets into your scene (from the top menu: Assets -> Import Package -> Characters). The Standard Assets can be found for free on the Unity Asset Store.

3. Add the ThirdPersonController to the your scene; drag it from the Project window (in Standard Assets -> Characters -> ThirdPersonCharacter -> Prefabs -> ThirdPersonController) into the Hierarchy window. Check its Position and Rotation transforms are all at 0 (in the Inspector  window).

4. Drag either the BloodFX, FireFX or IceFreezeFX and ShatterFX from the Prefabs folder in the Project window onto the root node of your character model in the hierarchy window.

5. Next, copy the corresponding scipt (CharacterBlood, CharacterFire or CharacterIce) from the Scripts folder onto the root of your character model.

6. Select your character model in the hierarchy window, then in Inspector window (on the right), scroll to the bottom to find the script you've just added. Next to "Mat", click the triangle and type in how many materials your character mode has. Then drag each material used on the character model from the project window into each of the material slots in the script.

7. Drag the effects gameobject that you added to you character in step 1 into the next slot in the script (ie, for FireFX drag the FireFX game object from the character group into the Fire FX script slot).

8. For the fire and ice effects you also need to copy the dynamic light into the next slot in the script (ie, for FireFX, expand out the group to see its children in the hierarchy window, then drag Explode_Light into the respective script slot in the Inspector window).

9. Most of the particle effects are spawned from a skinned character mesh, so these need to be linked up. Those that need to be linked are:

FireFX:
Ember_Particles
Ember_Local_Particles
Explode_Fire_Particles
Ash_Particles
Smoke_Particles

IceFreezeFX and IceShatterFX:
Frost_Particles
Smoke_Particles
Shattered_Ice_A_Particles
Shattered_Ice_B_Particles

BloodFX:
Blood_A_Particles
Blood_B_Particles
Flesh_A_Particles
Flesh_B_Particles
Blood_Splats_A_Particles
Blood_Splats_B_Particles
Blood_Mist_Particles

To link a particle effect, select the particle effect in the Hierarchy window (under the GameObject with all the grouped effects), then in the Inspector window scroll down to the Shape particle effect options. Next to Mesh, click the circular icon (to the right, where it may say "Non (Skinned Mesh Renderer)") to bring up all the skinned meshs in your current scene, then select the character skinned mesh.

10. Some of the particle effects can (optionally) collide with the ground, so a ground plane needs to be specified if this is required. The effect that collide with the ground are:

FireFX:
Ash_Particles

IceFreezeFX and IceShatterFX:
Shattered_Ice_A_Particles
Shattered_Ice_B_Particles

BloodFX:
Blood_A_Particles
Blood_B_Particles
Flesh_A_Particles
Flesh_B_Particles

11. To turn on particle collisions, select the effect in the Hierarchy window (under the GameObject with all the grouped effects), then in the Inspector window scroll down to the Collision section. Then drag your Ground plane into the Planes node (where it may say "None (Transform)"), or select the circle icon on the right to select your ground plane in the scene.


One thing important to note is that your character materials are updated and overwritten at run-time, so make sure you have made a backup.


Have fun!
